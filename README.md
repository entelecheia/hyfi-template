- PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/hyfi-template][pypi-url]


HyFI-Template is a ready-to-use GitHub template repository designed to streamline the process of initializing new projects based on HyFI, a robust framework for building interfaces for Python applications. HyFI leverages the power of the Hydra configuration system and the Pydantic data validation library, offering a comprehensive set of tools to create flexible and adaptable interfaces for various Python projects.

## Features

HyFI-Template provides an ideal starting point for developers looking to build projects using the HyFI framework, with key features including:

- **Pre-configured structure**: The template repository comes with a pre-defined project structure, ensuring a consistent and organized layout for HyFI-based applications.

- **Quick project initialization**: With the `make init-project` command, developers can easily initialize a new project, automatically setting up the necessary files, directories, and configurations.

- **Hydra integration**: The template repository is built around the Hydra configuration system, providing a flexible and powerful foundation for managing configurations in HyFI-based projects.

- **Pydantic integration**: HyFI-Template incorporates the Pydantic data validation library, allowing developers to easily define and validate data structures for their application interfaces.

- **Best practices**: The template repository follows industry best practices for Python project organization and structure, ensuring that developers have a solid starting point for building high-quality applications.

- **Customizable**: Developers can easily customize the template repository to suit their specific requirements and preferences, tailoring it to the needs of their projects.

- **Documentation**: The template repository includes clear instructions and guidelines for getting started with a HyFI-based project, helping developers quickly familiarize themselves with the framework and its features.

## Getting Started

To begin using HyFI-Template for your project, simply follow these steps:

1. Click the "Use this template" button on the [HyFI-Template GitHub repository](https://github.com/hyfi/hyfi-template) to create a new repository based on the template.
2. Clone the newly created repository to your local machine.
3. Run `make init-project` to initialize the project with the necessary files and configurations.
4. Follow the provided documentation and guidelines to start building your HyFI-based application.

By using HyFI-Template as the foundation for your project, you'll be well on your way to creating powerful and adaptable interfaces for your Python applications.
